/* We are trying to make an app that downloads a web page using it's url and a path to save it to.

- A function that will take 2 arguments

- Should look like this - download(pageURL, savePath)

- Use the npm needle library for the HTTP connection ( instead of using the normal 'net' built in to Node.)

- Use Node fs module to write / save the file.

- easy peasy lemon squeezy?
*/

const needle = require('needle');
const fs = require('fs');

const download = function(url, savePath) {
